🚦 Pedestrian Safety System using Arduino

A basic pedestrian safety prototype developed using Arduino UNO, an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, and a Servo Motor.
The system automatically detects nearby objects and triggers a safety response.

🔍 Project Overview

Measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor

Identifies objects within a 20 cm range

Activates a servo motor to represent a safety action

Shows real-time distance readings in the Serial Monitor
